# About Me

Matthew E. Perks is a PhD candidate at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in the department of [Sociology & Legal Studies](https://uwaterloo.ca/sociology-and-legal-studies/). He is a research assistant affiliated with SSHRC-funded  project [Indie Interfaces](https://www.indieinterfaces.com/).

His research focuses on the shifting role of community management for online media platforms and the working conditions of those who curate digital communities. In his doctoral work, he focuses on the increasingly embedded nature of community management in game development and how this impacts media creation and digital community livelihood.

Outside of his main dissertation work, Matthew has interviewed video game developers on projects about gender diversity policies in federal arts funding, cultural intermediary work in the creative and cultural industries, and community management work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

His previous studies during his Master's degree focused on pro-environmental behaviours in the Canadian population, utilizing aggregate population-level data across Canada as well as the unregulated and increased use of gambling-like mechanics in video games. Matthew previously worked for the Public Health Agency of Canada where he aided in the Health Inequality Reporting Initative with the Social Determinants and Science Integration Directorate.
