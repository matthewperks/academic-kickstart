# Biography

Matthew E. Perks is a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the department of Sociology & Legal Studies. His research focuses on the socio-economics of the video game industry and how these inform and alter the design decisions and identities of video game developers. He is currently researching and working with video game developers on projects about gender diversity policies in the arts funding, cultural intermediary work in the games industry, and how community management impacts video game development practices.

His previous work during his Master's degree focused on data and gamification of pro-environmental behaviours in the Canadian population, utilizing aggregate population-level data across Canada. Matthew previously worked for the Public Health Agency of Canada where he worked on the Health Inequality Reporting Initative with the   Social Determinants and Science Integration Directorate.
