abstract = "Diversity issues within cultural and creative industries are well-known, detailing the systemic and organizational barriers that women and other marginalized people face (Gill, 2014; Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2015; Proctor-Thomson, 2013). The uneven distribution of creative work across these intersecting identities has led to lower pay, greater inequality, and limitations to the freedoms of both those marginalized and those who traditionally are not (Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2015). In an effort to reduce this inequality out of workplaces, governments, activists, and employers began the systemic counting of women and other marginalized peoples (Proctor-Thomson, 2013). This method of attempting ‘manage out’ inequality fails to account for gendered practices and norms that are ingratiated within workplace structures and culture and makes the critique of sexist practices within workplaces difficult (Gill, 2014; Lewis & Simpson, 2012). This transformation into ‘new sexism’ represents a noticeable shift in a post-feminist, individualistic, neoliberal climate where sexism becomes more agile, flexible, mobile, and harder to resist (Gill, 2014). A post-structuralist and return to feminist approaches to understanding the systemic gendering and construction of creative norms reveals hidden dimensions of power and consequences to this work of counting marginalized bodies (Lewis & Simpson, 2012).

This paper examines the intersectional complications surrounding the counting of women and other diverse peoples (e.g. trans, racial/cultural minorities, queer individuals) as a means of increasing diversity. While these policies do force game studios to hire and promote women, there are potential harms that arise. This potentially includes a tokenization of those who aren’t as amenable to being categorized so neatly by policymakers and the formative role of self-surveillance by developers to meet quotas. While there are positive effects associated with these quota practices, these policies arguably reveal and expose marginalized individuals in ways that may be harmful. In doing so, they are expected to act as ambassadors for their communities in ways that are not empathetic or understanding of their individual lived experience and the multiplicity of lived experiences by those in wider marginalized communities. Marginalized people are increasingly asked to be accountable for issues of representation within media and wider culture, to act as envoys of their communities and educators to their oppressors.

This project aims to address the consequences of these policies through a case study of the Canada Media Fund, a not-for-profit corporation that delivers $349.7 million in funding annually to support the Canadian television and digital media industries. In 2017-2018, they introduced gender initiatives expressly aimed at increasing the representation of women in CMF-funded projects. This talk will summarize recently implemented gender initiatives, interview data with developers regarding the policy, and, drawing from creative and cultural industry literature, theorize on potentially more effective strategies to get and keep diverse people in games development communities. Additionally, to theorize about the implications of these strategies that go beyond simple issues of gender representation and diversity in cultural and creative workplaces, to the consequences for transgender individuals, people of colour, and other queer communities.
